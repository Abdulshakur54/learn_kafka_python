This repository stores the files and codes I wrote while taking the course [APACHE KAFKA FOR PYTHON DEVELOPERS](https://developer.confluent.io/courses/kafka-python/intro/)

it is a follow up course to the [KAFKA 101 (Kafka Fundamentals course) I had taken initially](https://developer.confluent.io/courses/apache-kafka/events/)

* I took a deep look at the Producer Class using JSONSerializers and Schema Registry to serialize event to Kafka [view script](./json_producer.py)
* A deep look at the Consumer Class was also taking using JSONDeserilizer [view script](./json_consumer.py)
* I also wrote a script using the AdminClient Class to provision, list and manage some kafka resource [view script](./admin.py)# learn_kafka_python
